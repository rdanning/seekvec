# SEEK-VEC: Spectral Ensembling of topic models with Eigenscore for K-Agnostic Vector Embedding and Classification

## Purpose of SEEK-VEC

This package implements the method presented in the paper "SEEK-VEC: Robust Latent Structure Discovery via Ensembled Topic Modeling" (Danning et al.).

SEEK-VEC is an ensemble machine learning method for detecting latent structure in count data. SEEK-VEC can be used to prioritize the vocabulary, detect robust relationships among words, and perform model diagnostics on candidate topic models.

## Getting started
To install the R package 'seekvec', enter the following commands in R:

`install.packages("devtools")`
